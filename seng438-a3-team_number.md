# 1 Introduction

The primary goal of this lab is to explore white box testing using the JUnit framework, along with using EclEmma (coverage tool) that measures how thoroughly our test suite exercises the code. This lab will tell us what we have missed and what have we done for coverage in lab 2 as we dive deeper to learn about the interal structure of the software. This lab will ensure us that all logical statements, branches, and conditions are adequately tested. 

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

A pro to working with EclEmma is its real-time feedback. Specifically the feature to highlight code that was executed and code that could have been executed. This feature helped identify what code still needed to be tested or sections of code that were unreachable. A con to this coverage tool would be its limitations to plug-ins. Specifically being unable to handle mocking plug-in. Since mocking is used for testing complex functions and methods, the inability to provide accurate coverage can lead to sections of code being misrepresented in the coverage.

The metrics we used for this assignment were instruction coverage, branch coverage and method coverage. Method coverage replaced condition coverage as condition coverage was not a metric in our coverage tool
